Package: boinc-amd-opencl
Description-md5: 6e0625247955d16f5c815fea6934b5fa
Description-en: metapackage for AMD/ATI OpenCL-savvy BOINC client and manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the configuration of BOINC for the OpenCL-savvy AMD/ATI
 graphics cards.  This package adds a series of dependencies from the
 non-free section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this
 binary package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.
 .
 This package is not perfect, yet. A major problem for the moment
 is the availability of the OpenCL driver for 32bit binaries for
 amd64. If this is planned, install the amd-app package provided
 through the AMD developer forum.

 and then execute it.
 Cache and configuration files will be stored in ~/.cache/torbrowser and
 ~/.config/torbrowser.
 Each subsequent execution after installation will simply launch the most
 recent TBB. Tor Browser will be fetched, verified and unpacked each time a new
 version of TBB is released. When you open Tor Browser Launcher after an update,
 it will download the newer version of TBB for you and extract it over your old
 TBB directory in ~/.local/share/torbrowser, so you will maintain your TBB
 bookmarks.
