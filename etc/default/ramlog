#Ramlog service configuration

RAMDISKTYPE=0		#0 = tmpfs (can be swapped)
			#1 = ramfs (no max size in older kernels, cannot be swapped, not SELinux friendly)
			#2 = old kernel ramdisk
			# (kernel ramdisk needs kernel parameter "ramdisk_size=" in kilobytes as default kernel ramdisk size
			#  is usually lower than the size of the /var/log)

TMPFS_RAMFS_SIZE=256m	#Maximum size of memory to be used by tmpfs or ramfs. 
			# The value can be percentage of total RAM or size in megabytes - for example:
			# TMPFS_RAMFS_SIZE=256m40%
			# TMPFS_RAMFS_SIZE=256m100m
			# Empty value means default tmpfs/ramfs size: TMPFS_RAMFS_SIZE=256m
			# For more options please check 'man mount', section 'Mount options for tmpfs' 
			# (by the way - ramfs supports size limit in newer kernels as well despite man says there are no mount options)
			# It has only effect if RAMDISKTYPE=0 or 1

KERNEL_RAMDISK_SIZE=MAX #Kernel ramdisk size in kilobytes or MAX to use entire ramdisk. It has only effect if RAMDISKTYPE=2

LOGGING=1		#0=off, 1=on
LOGNAME=ramlog		#name of the ramlog log file (makes sense if LOGGING=1)

VERBOSE=1		#0=off, 1=on (if 1, teststartstop puts detials to the logs and it is called after start or stop fails)
